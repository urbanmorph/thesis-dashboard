## What Changed

### 🏗️ Buildings Sector (COMPLETE)

**5 sections rewritten** (~40,000 chars added):
- Section 2 (TARGETS): +32% - Shift Indicators + Outcome Indicators
- Section 5 (SHIFT): +349% - 6 paradigm shifts with breakthrough moments
- Section 6 (MARKERS): +140% - Leading/Lagging/Discourse markers
- Section 7 (STRATEGIES): +137% - Organized by shift-enabling power

2. **Reframing**: Problem Contributors → Solution Mediums (regenerative infrastructure)
3. **Agency**: Passive Owners → Active Demanders (buyers demanding energy ratings)
4. **Governance**: Top-Down → Collective Action + Structured Accountability
5. **Time Horizon**: Short-Term → Long-Term + Evidence Loops

## Sector-by-Sector Paradigm Shift Differences

| Dimension | Buildings | Air Quality | Energy |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Ontological** | Human-centric → Bio-centric | Invisible externality → Visible health commons | Commodity supply → Service delivery |
| **Reframing** | Problem → Solution medium | Monitoring → Solving at source | Coal necessity → Managed transition |
| **Agency** | Passive owners → Active demanders | Passive victims → Active protectors | Passive consumers → Active prosumers |
| **Governance** | Top-down → Accountability | City silos → Airshed coordination | DISCOM monopoly → Open market |
| **Time Horizon** | Construction cost → Lifecycle | Crisis response → Prevention | Peak adequacy → System flexibility |
| **Objectives** | Carbon only → Multi-dimensional | PM2.5 only → Health outcomes | Supply-side → Demand-side optimization |

**Key Insight**: Each sector's shifts reflect its unique systemic barriers:
- **Buildings**: Individual building performance, buyer-seller relationships
- **Air Quality**: Cross-jurisdictional governance, visibility of harm
- **Energy**: Infrastructure lock-in, political economy of coal transition

## Remaining 6 Sectors (Not Yet Updated)

The following sectors still use the old structure:

| Sector | Priority | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Transport** | HIGH | Urban master plan revision window; EV/NMT decisions now |
| **Water** | HIGH | Groundwater tipping point; JJM expansion decisions |
| **Waste** | MEDIUM | EPR framework implementation; circular economy policies |
| **Neighbourhoods** | MEDIUM | Ward-level governance reforms; 74th Amendment implementation |
| **Food** | MEDIUM | Agricultural transformation; cold chain investments |
| **Biodiversity** | LOW | Already reorganized with 10-section structure (done earlier) |

**Total remaining work**: ~6 sectors × 4-5 hours = 24-30 hours

## Known Issues / Notes

### ✅ RESOLVED: Air Quality Sankey
- **Issue**: Sankey div existed but no JavaScript rendering
- **Root cause**: HTML had `id="air-sankey"` but no matching JavaScript
- **Fix**: Added Air Pollution Flow Sankey at line 5422 with data:
  - Sources: Road Dust 32%, Vehicles 27%, Industry 30%, Construction 10%, Stubble 7%
  - Health impacts: 0.95M deaths/year, 27.4M DALYs, $36.8B GDP loss
- **Status**: FIXED ✅

### Potential Issues to Watch

1. **Long page length**: sectors.html is now 5,800+ lines
   - May impact load times on slow connections
   - Consider lazy-loading Sankey diagrams if performance issues

2. **Mobile rendering**: New content adds significant vertical scroll
   - Test on actual mobile devices (not just browser resize)
   - Check that two-column layouts collapse properly

3. **Citation coverage**: Some new content may lack citations
   - Audit all data points to ensure sources
   - Add missing references to reference-mapping.json

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. **User verification**: Test the 3 sectors thoroughly
2. **Feedback collection**: Which shifts resonate? Any confusing?
3. **Air Sankey validation**: Does the pollution flow make sense?

### Short-term (This Week)
4. **Decide on remaining 6 sectors**: Continue with all or selective?
5. **Priority order**: Transport + Water (HIGH) vs all 6 sequentially?
6. **Model selection**: Keep using Opus for research + Sonnet for implementation?

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
7. **Complete all 9 sectors**: Apply paradigm shift framework
8. **Cross-sector analysis**: Identify inter-sector shifts (e.g., Energy → Transport electrification)
9. **Dashboard integration**: Add shift progress tracking to main dashboard

### Long-term (Next Month)
10. **Data collection**: Set up leading indicator tracking
11. **Breakthrough monitoring**: Create system to detect when shifts become irreversible
12. **Public communication**: How to explain paradigm shifts to stakeholders?

## Paradigm Shift Framework: Why It Matters

### The Fundamental Insight

**Traditional approach**: Track interventions (solar GW installed, AQI measurements, ECBC buildings)

**Paradigm shift approach**: Track the CAUSES that enable interventions (prosumer mindset, health-AQ visibility, buyer demand for efficiency)

### The Causal Chain

```
Paradigm Shift → Removes Hidden Dynamic → Enables Strategy → Produces Intervention → Creates Outcome
```

**Example from Buildings:**
1. **Shift 3**: Passive owners → Active demanders (paradigm change)
2. **Removes**: Split incentives (developers minimize cost, buyers pay bills)
3. **Enables**: Energy disclosure at transaction (strategy)
4. **Produces**: Mandatory EPCs for sale/rent (intervention)
5. **Creates**: 30% building energy intensity reduction (outcome)

### Why Paradigm Shifts Are Superior Predictors

1. **Durability**: Persist beyond policy changes; self-reinforcing
2. **Scalability**: One shift enables multiple interventions
3. **Systemic**: Address root causes, not symptoms
4. **Leading indicators**: Signal transformation before outcomes appear

### The 6 Universal Dimensions

These apply to ANY sector:
1. **Ontological**: What is the sector FOR?
2. **Reframing**: How do we talk about it?
3. **Agency**: Who drives change?
4. **Governance**: How are decisions made?
5. **Time Horizon**: Optimize for when?
6. **Objectives**: What do we measure?
