| **1. Ontological** | What is the sector FOR? | Redefine fundamental purpose |
| **2. Reframing** | How do we TALK about it? | Change the narrative |
| **3. Agency** | Who DRIVES change? | Shift power and ownership |
| **4. Governance** | How are DECISIONS made? | Transform decision structures |
| **5. Time Horizon** | Optimize for WHEN? | Extend planning horizons |
| **6. Objectives** | What do we MEASURE? | Broaden success metrics |

## Cross-Sector Paradigm Shift Patterns

### Common Ontological Shifts

**From commodity/service → To systemic purpose:**
- Buildings: Thermal comfort → Living ecosystems
- Energy: kWh sold → Reliable access
- Transport: Vehicle movement → People accessibility
- Water: Infinite resource → Finite commons
- Waste: Nuisance to dispose → Resource to circulate
- Food: Calories produced → Nutrition accessed

### Common Agency Shifts

**From passive consumers → To active co-producers:**
- Buildings: Passive owners → Active demanders
- Energy: Passive consumers → Active prosumers
- Transport: Captive users → Choice riders
- Water: Passive recipients → Active stewards
- Waste: Passive generators → Active value creators
- Neighbourhoods: Complaint-makers → Co-creators
- Food: Subsistence farmers → Market-linked producers

### Common Governance Shifts

**From fragmented/top-down → To integrated/accountable:**
- Buildings: Top-down mandates → Collective action
- Energy: DISCOM monopoly → Open market
- Air: City silos → Airshed coordination
- Transport: Fragmented agencies → Unified mobility authority
- Water: Supply expansion → Demand management
- Waste: Municipality collects → Producer responsibility
- Neighbourhoods: Top-down → Ward-level accountability
- Food: Siloed ministries → Integrated food systems

## Breakthrough Moments by Sector

**Transport**: First city master plan adopts "peak car" target with declining vehicle mode share

**Water**: First state enforces groundwater extraction caps in 100 over-exploited blocks with borewell meters

**Waste**: City announces zero-waste-to-landfill target AND reports recycling revenue > disposal costs

**Neighbourhoods**: 50% of wards have functioning committees with budgets + dashboards + participatory planning

**Food**: Punjab announces crop diversification MSP expansion - millet/pulses at rice/wheat parity

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. ✅ **Complete 5 remaining sectors** - DONE
2. ✅ **Update CLAUDE.md** - DONE
3. ✅ **Run vite build** - DONE (763ms, 627.22 KB)
4. ✅ **Verify HTML structure** - DONE (depth: 0)
5. ⚠️ **Test in browser** - Needs manual verification

### Testing Checklist

For each of the 5 new sectors (Transport, Water, Waste, Neighbourhoods, Food):

- [ ] Open `http://localhost:5173/sectors.html` (or deployed URL)
- [ ] Click sector tab
- [ ] Verify Section 5 (SHIFT) displays with 6 numbered paradigm shifts
- [ ] Check "What This Looks Like" gray boxes
- [ ] Check "Breakthrough Moment" blue boxes
- [ ] Verify "Addresses Hidden Dynamic" links to Section 4
- [ ] Verify Section 6 (MARKERS) has Leading/Lagging/Discourse split
- [ ] Verify Section 7 (STRATEGIES) shows High/Medium/Foundational tiers
- [ ] Verify Section 10 (FOCUS AREAS) has urgency-ranked cards
- [ ] Check all citation links work (click → resources.html#ref-{slug})
- [ ] Test mobile responsive (375px, 768px, 1440px)

### Short-term (This Week)

6. **User verification**: Test all 8 sectors thoroughly
7. **Feedback collection**: Which shifts resonate? Any confusing?
8. **Biodiversity decision**: Apply paradigm shifts or keep current structure?

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)

9. **Cross-sector analysis**: Identify inter-sector shifts (e.g., Energy → Transport electrification)
10. **Dashboard integration**: Add shift progress tracking to main dashboard
11. **Data collection**: Set up leading indicator tracking systems

### Long-term (Next Month)

12. **Breakthrough monitoring**: Create system to detect when shifts become irreversible
13. **Public communication**: How to explain paradigm shifts to stakeholders?
14. **Policy integration**: Map shifts to current policy windows (NCAP 2.0, JJM Phase 2, etc.)

**Implementation**: Sonnet execution + Opus validation
**Methodology**: User-provided Buildings paradigm shifts → generalized to universal framework
**Integration**: Python scripts + manual HTML verification
**Data Sources**: Economic Survey 2026, CPCB, MOHUA, sector-specific reports

## Production Deployment

**Current Status**: All changes in development environment
**Dev Server**: http://localhost:5173/sectors.html
**Production Build**: `dist/` directory ready for deployment

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Push to main branch
2. Vercel auto-deploys from `dist/`
3. Monitor build logs
4. UAT on production URL

**Rollback Plan**:
```bash
# If critical issues found
git revert <commit-hash>
# OR restore from backup
cp sectors.html.backup-before-5-sectors sectors.html
npm run build
```

---

**Ready for User Verification**: All 8 sectors with paradigm shift framework integrated, HTML validated, build successful.

**Test Priority**: Transport → Water → Waste → Neighbourhoods → Food (in integration order)

**Critical Questions**:
1. Do the paradigm shifts make sense?
2. Are they actionable?
3. Are breakthrough moments credible?
4. Do leading/lagging/discourse markers track the right things?
